## Obtaining a Khoury account

Note that all assignments are tested and graded on the Khoury web servers: `ssh your_user_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` (i.e. running an assignment on your Mac, is NOT the same environment as our Khoury servers which run a linux system).

[Creating a Khoury account if you need one](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/systems/getting-started/) 

## Logistics
For all assignments, you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete the assignments. The reason is because the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is where your submission will be graded. While it is true you can probably do much of the assignments locally (if you have a Mac, Windows Terminal, or Linux machine), you **must** make sure your submissions work on the Khoury servers.
